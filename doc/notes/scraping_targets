Here are some ways to locate new and trending assets, especially in the realm of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):

1. **Oxalus**: An NFT analytics platform. In addition to providing NFT market space, total supply, and price, it provides an analysis regarding community score, community growth rate, and engagement rate. It also offers an "Advance mode" that allows you to add the mint/release date to your calendar and get alerts for upcoming NFT projects【7†source】.

2. **NFT OnChained**: This tool tracks underpriced listings of NFTs using machine learning to estimate the current fair value of NFTs. It considers rarity, traits, market data, and other factors for price estimates for each individual NFT. Its main feature, the "Screener", lists the currently most underpriced NFTs across all tracked collections【8†source】.

3. **BitDegree**: Useful for revealing and analyzing various NFT collections from the market. BitDegree allows you to build your personal portfolio and easily track the progress of all your favorite NFTs【9†source】.

9. **NFT Drops Calendar**: This platform keeps track of all the upcoming drops, alerts about giveaways, events, and sales related to NFTs. It also has a search and sorting feature for easy navigation【15†source】.

For the second part of your question, regarding how these methods could be incorporated into an automated system, it's important to note that this would depend significantly on the API access and automation capabilities of each specific tool. Many of these platforms might have APIs that can be incorporated into automated systems, but the specifics would need to be checked on a case-by-case basis.

As for other types of assets, I was unable to locate specific tools that track new and trending assets in a broader sense. There are various financial news and analytics platforms that offer information on trending assets, but these are usually not specific to new assets, and their integration into an automated system would also depend on the specific platform's API and automation capabilities.



1. **Financial News and Analysis**: Financial news outlets often report on trending assets. Outlets like Bloomberg, CNBC, Financial Times, etc., regularly publish articles on new and potentially lucrative assets.

2. **Investment Research Platforms**: Platforms like Morningstar, Zacks, and others provide comprehensive research and analysis on various assets and sectors. These platforms can be a rich source of information for spotting trends.

3. **Social Media and Online Communities**: Platforms like Twitter, Reddit (particularly the subreddit r/investing), and others often discuss trending assets. Sentiment analysis can be done to gauge the popularity of certain assets.

4. **Automated Trend-Following Systems**: There are many tools and software available that use algorithms to identify trends in various assets. They analyze market data and use statistical measures to identify potential trends.

5. **Professional Financial Advisors and Brokerages**: These professionals often have a pulse on the market and can provide advice on trending assets.

6. **Industry Reports and Whitepapers**: These often contain in-depth analysis and predictions about various sectors and assets.

However, for more specific methods or tools that can be added to an automated system, I wasn't able to find detailed information during this search. Could you please provide more details about the type of assets you are interested in (stocks, commodities, real estate, etc.)? This will help me provide more tailored and relevant information.
